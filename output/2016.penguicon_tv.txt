Up to four other players take on the roles of courageous heroes who embark on quests and venture into dangerous caves, ancient ruins, dark dungeons, and cursed forests to battle monsters, earn riches, and attempt to stop the overlord from carrying out his vile plot. Combat uses a unique dice-based system. Players build their dice pools according to their character's abilities and weapons, and each die in the pool contributes to an attack in different ways. Surges, special symbols that appear on most dice, also let you trigger special effects to make the most of your attacks. And with the horrors awaiting you beneath the surface, you'll need every advantage you can take...)

Title (Encrypted Backups with Tarsnap)
Description (Online backup is incredibly useful, but has many privacy and integrity risks. Tarsnap is an online backup service that only handles your data in encrypted form. It's inexpensive and reliable. Plus you don't need to trust the Tarsnap service--they can't access your backups even if they want to. And Tarsnap's built-in deduplication saves space, letting you store terabytes of backups in mere gigabytes of disk. This talk takes you through using Tarsnap, from backing up a system to customizing and rotating backups, to fully restoring them.)

Daniel Franke, of the NTPsec project, thinks that both these perceptions are mistaken and that NTP's apparent impenetrability is entirely a consequence of bad pedagogy. In this talk, he aims to fix that. While some background in statistics will make this talk go down a bit more smoothly, a solid grasp of high school algebra should be entirely sufficient for following along.)

Title (Post Capitalism)
Description (Capitalism worked. The reason it's stalling is that its job is successfully finished: the job of efficient supply. But not demand. Universal employment is no longer needed; but with decreased employment, wages go down; therefore there are too few customers to buy products & services. Basic Income is gaining bipartisan support. Replace means-tested benefits with a monthly payment, distributed in the same amount to every citizen, pegged to productivity to stay ahead of inflation. Stop paying a bureaucracy to determine who needs or deserves social assistance. Income inequality is not just an ethical issue. The existence of a large middle class is the only way to keep the economy going.)

See if you can play a platform game with a game controller while squatting, or perform a 1 Arm Row with a band with 1 hand and play a retro shooter game that uses the directional buttons on a gamepad on the other hand. The player with the highest number of reps wins. An awesome way to experience somewhat obscure, yet awesome console and PC games, while burning off some con-calories at the same time.)

You take a deep breath and begin...only to helplessly watch as the story falls directly on its face.

Meant mainly for teachers, sys admins, and web developers, this talk will focus on what Moodle is, how it is managed, and how to become a part of the Moodle community.

Title (The Correctness Problem)
Description (Software is terrible. If you work in software, you know this almost rises to the level of truism. There's a long, strong tradition of prognosticating doom among software folks. This talk is about why software is so awful (spoiler: humans are bad at it), how we software folk cope with that awfulness, and most importantly, the implications that the *particular* nature of the awfulness has for modern and future society. It should be interesting for engineers and non-engineers alike. My hope is that attendees will leave with a stronger sense of what realistic risks are posed by the terribleness of software.)
