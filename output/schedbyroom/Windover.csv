Lucas","PAM- or Pluggable Authentication Modules- is one of the most occult parts of managing Unixish systems. The unique configuration syntax and idiosyncratic rule processing drives many sysadmins to copy working configurations from other people and random blog posts. This talk takes you through the essentials of PAM configuration- You'll learn the components of PAM- how PAM processes rules- how to use multi-factor authentication- and get an overview of some useful PAM modules you probably haven't used- based on my book 'PAM Mastery.'",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

Lucas","Too many organizations have a tense relationship between the network folks and the sysadmins. Sometimes it degenerates just short of war. But basic networking isn't hard--if it was- network engineers couldn't do it. This talk teaches the essentials- in a way that lets sysadmins troubleshoot network problems on their own. Sysadmins have amazing visibility into the network- once they know how to use it. We'll cover cross-platform tools for viewing and troubleshooting the network- on both Windows and Unix.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

They are the co-authors of the O'Reilly book 'Raspberry Pi Hacks'- and generally do all sorts of things with the credit-card sized computer that are fun and warranty voiding.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
4/30/2016,15:00,4/30/2016,15:50,50 minutes,"Windover","Tech","Fun with Mind Reading","Jennifer Marsman","Using EEG and Azure Machine Learning to perform lie detection. Today- we have the technology to “read minds” (well- EEG waves!).  Using an EPOC headset from Emotiv- I have captured 14 channels of EEG (brain waves) while subjects lied and answered truthfully to a series of questions.  I fed this labelled dataset into Azure Machine Learning to build a classifier which predicts whether a subject is telling the truth or lying.  In this session- I will share my results on this “lie detector” experiment.  I will show my machine learning models- data cleaning process- results- and next steps/resources. ",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
4/30/2016,16:00,4/30/2016,16:50,50 minutes,"Windover","Tech","Encrypted Backups with Tarsnap","Michael W. Lucas","Online backup is incredibly useful- but has many privacy and integrity risks. Tarsnap is an online backup service that only handles your data in encrypted form. It's inexpensive and reliable. Plus you don't need to trust the Tarsnap service--they can't access your backups even if they want to. And Tarsnap's built-in deduplication saves space- letting you store terabytes of backups in mere gigabytes of disk. This talk takes you through using Tarsnap- from backing up a system to customizing and rotating backups- to fully restoring them.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

Oh yeah. Acting Appropriately Stupid? Got that too) and five clips per category- the audience decides which clip gets to take home the title of best of the worst. Come for some or come for all. It's free- fun and other F adjectives! This panel is for ages 18+ only. Minors are not allowed (with or without a parent).",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

In this talk- I will discuss different types of machine learning (clustering- classification- regression- and anomaly detection) supported by Azure Machine Learning. I’ll demonstrate using Azure Machine Learning to build a model which predicts survival of individuals on the Titanic (one of the challenges on the Kaggle website). You’ll leave knowing how to get started and build your own predictive models using Azure Machine Learning. ",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
