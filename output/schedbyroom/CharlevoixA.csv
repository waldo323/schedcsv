Daniel Franke- of the NTPsec project- thinks that both these perceptions are mistaken and that NTP's apparent impenetrability is entirely a consequence of bad pedagogy. In this talk- he aims to fix that.

The United States Supreme Court's ruling in the landmark Alice vs. CLS Bank case has finally given the lower courts some tools they could use to overturn obvious and vague patents- but there are still several things we need to pay attention to- and a very long tail to contend with. The best way to keep moving forward is for the global community to work together. This talk is for anyone who is wondering what the recent decisions mean for small and mid-size entities- how international treaties can impact local policy and what can be done to improve the situation.
