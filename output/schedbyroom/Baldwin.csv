Christopher Bright shows us how to use the Arduino microcontroller to take in information and then express it through lights- sounds- or motion. The potential here is limitless. Arduinos have been used to build opensource EEG machines- heart rate monitors- robotic motion controllers. In this workshop you will create a heart-rate sensor that in turn flashes an LED on time. Easy- and very fun. I will have plenty of micro boards on hand for folks to play with and a selection of kits for sale at dramatically reduced prices compared to retail.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
