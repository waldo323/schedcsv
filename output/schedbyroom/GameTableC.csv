A game lasts ten real-time minutes- while a soundtrack plays- announcing various timed challenges: from space battleships and interceptors- to different interstellar monsters and abominations- asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree and coordinate on who will do what (moving around the ship- firing weapons- distributing energy- using battlebots to deal with intruders- launching guided missiles- etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.",FALSE,DEFAULT,"none"

Beginners encouraged to attend. Learn how to play this Living Customizable Card Game for two players- set in the cyberpunk future of 'Android' and 'Infiltration'! One player is a megacorporation and the other is a runner. Corporations must secure their servers and data forts with security programs. Runners need to spend their time and credits developing sufficiently powerful wealth- hardware- and software to hack past corporate security measures.

Lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim mastery of the dystopian world. Produce commodities- dig tunnels to opposing areas- construct markets- collect artifacts- strengthen allegiances- and fulfill secret agendas. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge— his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. This gives bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of your workers gets too high- one of them might desert you! Control areas by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of freedoms upon other players. Gather rare artifacts from the old world- coveted by the elite- to exchange for tracts of land.",FALSE,DEFAULT,"none"
