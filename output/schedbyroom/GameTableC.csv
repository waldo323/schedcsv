A game lasts ten real-time minutes- while a soundtrack plays- announcing various timed challenges: from space battleships and interceptors- to different interstellar monsters and abominations- asteroids or even intruders and malfunctions on the spaceship. Players have to agree and coordinate on who will do what (moving around the ship- firing weapons- distributing energy- using battlebots to deal with intruders- launching guided missiles- etc.) in real time to defend the ship. Only a well-working team can survive 10 minutes and make the jump back to safety.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

Lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim mastery of the dystopian world.

The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge  his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. This gives bonuses and impacts player interaction.
