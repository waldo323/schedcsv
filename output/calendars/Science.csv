Science is a continual and methodical process to match models to data (phenomenon) for utilitarian purposes. Science has the following Elements: Data; Models (e.g. Theories); Properties of Models, including computational characteristics and data matching measures; and Properties of Data, including measures of data to real world mapping. Science has no opinions, has no votes, no laws, no authorities, only naked properties, and measures. Lessons include: Reality, Models, Spaghetti, Measurement, Development, and Issues. Examples include: Entropy, Transformation of Energy, Relativity, and Sub-Quantum Kinetics.
