Yet Craig spent the last few years collecting for this machine. Why? Should these machines be relegated as mere curiosities of a forgotten age? Has Craig gone completely mental? Come learn the history of the Sinclair machines, their foray into the USA market via Timex, and see why these machines deserve more attention than they received.
