Topic elements include Search Engines, RSS Feeds, and Links, in addition to typical web page elements. This is a different way of slicing web information, where the focus is on Topics as opposed to a focus on a Search Engine, device, browser, or RSS Feed. TopicHero arises from a philosophy that it is the topic that is critical and that users need effective tools to bring as many resources to bear on specific topics as possible. This is particularly true in business where many users are dedicated to working on specific topics for long periods of time. </blurb></event>

<blurb><participant>Jennifer Marsman</participant> Using EEG and Azure Machine Learning to perform lie detection. Today, we have the technology to "read minds" (well, EEG waves!).  Using an EPOC headset from Emotiv, I have captured 14 channels of EEG (brain waves) while subjects lied and answered truthfully to a series of questions.  I fed this labelled dataset into Azure Machine Learning to build a classifier which predicts whether a subject is telling the truth or lying.  In this session, I will share my results on this "lie detector" experiment.  I will show my machine learning models, data cleaning process, results, and next steps/resources. </blurb></event>

<blurb><participant>Michael W. Lucas</participant> Online backup is incredibly useful, but has many privacy and integrity risks. Tarsnap is an online backup service that only handles your data in encrypted form. It's inexpensive and reliable. Plus you don't need to trust the Tarsnap service--they can't access your backups even if they want to. And Tarsnap's built-in deduplication saves space, letting you store terabytes of backups in mere gigabytes of disk. This talk takes you through using Tarsnap, from backing up a system to customizing and rotating backups, to fully restoring them. </blurb></event>

<topic>Action Adventure</topic>
<room>Algonquin A</room>
<blurb><participant>Janea Schimmel, Kent Kovac, Maggie Robinson, Ryan Carter</participant> Have you always wanted to do partner dancing, but find keeping yourself within a set pattern constraining? Blues dance is an American idiom of partner dance that is freeform with limitless possibilities for creativity, including throwing out the partner bit and going solo. While blues dance gave rise to hip hop dancing, it also survives in modern culture as the awkward high school slow dance. Except real blues dance has more, well, pizzazz and a lot less awkwardness. No need for special shoes or a partner, comes as you are and well help you learn to groove. <duration>1 hour and 50 minutes</duration></blurb></event>

<topic>After Dark</topic>
<room>Charlevoix C</room>
<blurb><participant>RainbowRavenX</participant> With adult coloring books on the rise, and as it becomes more acceptable for adults to enjoy traditionally 'kid' things, light is shed on a subculture called "age play." As with every subculture that suddenly finds itself in media spotlight, there are a lot of misconceptions. In this panel and discussion, we will attempt to put stereotypes to rest and remove some of the negative media stigma. Whether this is totally your scene, you know that one guy that does this, or you have no idea, come share your questions and experiences. We will cover the entire spectrum of this fun and interesting subculture. This panel is for ages 18+ only. Minors are not allowed (with or without a parent). </blurb></event>

<event><title>How NTP Works</title>
<topic>Tech</topic>
<room>Charlevoix A</room>
<blurb><participant>Daniel Franke</participant> Those who are unfamiliar with NTP, the Network Time Protocol which keeps your computer's clock in sync with the rest of the world, tend to assume it must be trivial. Those with slightly more familiarity are aware of its reputation for being deeply arcane and full of scary math. Daniel Franke, of the NTPsec project, thinks that both these perceptions are mistaken and that NTP's apparent impenetrability is entirely a consequence of bad pedagogy. In this talk, he aims to fix that. While some background in statistics will make this talk go down a bit more smoothly, a solid grasp of high school algebra should be entirely sufficient for following along. </blurb></event>

Are diverse characters, genre mashups, and unusual structures a benefit to the sales department or a hindrance? How can authors challenge new boundaries and still make the editors, agents and other gatekeepers happy and produce a book with mass appeal? Does this strategy change further into an author's career? Authors talk genre and classification and all the other challenges for this difficult subject. </blurb></event>

<blurb><participant>Ramses Alcaide</participant> One of the major human developments in the 21st century is the creation of new ways to allow people to interact and immerse with the world around them. Brian-Computer Interface has the potential to bring that interaction to a new level. However, current non-invasive brain technology is extremely limited in capability. Neurable has created the first non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows for unprecedented real-time control of physical objects and software applications, creating new ways for people to interact with the world, enabling deeper immersion in augmented reality &amp; virtual reality (AR/VR) environments. </blurb></event>

<topic>Tech</topic>
<room>Charlevoix A</room>
<blurb><participant>Deb Nicholson</participant> The last year's been very interesting for those of us who have been looking on in horror over the last decade as billions of dollars was spent on frivolous and ridiculously broad software patent litigation. The United States Supreme Court's ruling in the landmark Alice vs. CLS Bank case has finally given the lower courts some tools they could use to overturn obvious and vague patents, but there are still several things we need to pay attention to, and a very long tail to contend with. The best way to keep moving forward is for the global community to work together. This talk is for anyone who is wondering what the recent decisions mean for small and mid-size entities, how international treaties can impact local policy and what can be done to improve the situation. </blurb></event>

<topic>Life</topic>
<room>Charlevoix B</room>
<blurb><participant>Matt Arnold, Edward L. Platt, Kevin O'Brien, Zach Blagg, Dana Nelson (Moderator)</participant> Capitalism worked. The reason it's stalling is that its job is successfully finished: the job of efficient supply. But not demand. Universal employment is no longer needed; but with decreased employment, wages go down; therefore there are too few customers to buy products &amp; services. Basic Income is gaining bipartisan support. Replace means-tested benefits with a monthly payment, distributed in the same amount to every citizen, pegged to productivity to stay ahead of inflation. Stop paying a bureaucracy to determine who needs or deserves social assistance. Income inequality is not just an ethical issue. The existence of a large middle class is the only way to keep the economy going. </blurb></event>

<room>Nicolet</room>
<blurb><participant>Sam Boyer</participant> Software is terrible. If you work in software, you know this almost rises to the level of truism. There's a long, strong tradition of prognosticating doom among software folks. This talk is about why software is so awful (spoiler: humans are bad at it), how we software folk cope with that awfulness, and most importantly, the implications that the *particular* nature of the awfulness has for modern and future society. It should be interesting for engineers and non-engineers alike. My hope is that attendees will leave with a stronger sense of what realistic risks are posed by the terribleness of software. </blurb></event>
