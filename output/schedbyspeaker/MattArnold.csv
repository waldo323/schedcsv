"Post Capitalism",5/1/2016,13:00,5/1/2016,13:50,FALSE,"Capitalism worked. The reason it's stalling is that its job is successfully finished: the job of efficient supply. But not demand. Universal employment is no longer needed; but with decreased employment, wages go down; therefore there are too few customers to buy products & services. Basic Income is gaining bipartisan support. Replace means-tested benefits with a monthly payment, distributed in the same amount to every citizen, pegged to productivity to stay ahead of inflation. Stop paying a bureaucracy to determine who needs or deserves social assistance. Income inequality is not just an ethical issue. The existence of a large middle class is the only way to keep the economy going.  Speakers include:Matt Arnold, Edward L. Platt, Kevin O'Brien, Zach Blagg, Dana Nelson (Moderator) - Track: Life  - Duration: 50 minutes ","Charlevoix B",PUBLIC
