"Microprocessor Magic",4/29/2016,19:00,4/29/2016,19:50,FALSE,"Add movement, color, sound, and interactivity with a tiny computer system designed for artists and designers. Christopher Bright shows us how to use the Arduino microcontroller to take in information and then express it through lights, sounds, or motion. The potential here is limitless. Arduinos have been used to build opensource EEG machines, heart rate monitors, robotic motion controllers. In this workshop you will create a heart-rate sensor that in turn flashes an LED on time. Easy, and very fun. I will have plenty of micro boards on hand for folks to play with.  Speakers include:Christopher Bright - Track: DIY, Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes ","Baldwin",PUBLIC
