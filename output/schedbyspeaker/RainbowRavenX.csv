"So, What's This 'Age Play' Thing Anyway?",4/30/2016,22:00,4/30/2016,22:50,FALSE,"With adult coloring books on the rise, and as it becomes more acceptable for adults to enjoy traditionally 'kid' things, light is shed on a subculture called 'age play.'

In this panel and discussion, we will attempt to put stereotypes to rest and remove some of the negative media stigma.

We will cover the entire spectrum of this fun and interesting subculture. This panel is for ages 18+ only. Minors are not allowed (with or without a parent).
