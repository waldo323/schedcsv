"Warlords of the 6 Kingdoms",5/1/2016,12:00,5/1/2016,12:50,FALSE,"There can only be one! Take the role of a raucous, power-hungry warlord who’s off to conquer the 6 kingdoms! Select one city at a time, and send a champion to win it using the savory influence of fear, bribes, or pure military strength. If multiple warlords have sent a champion, the one with the highest of the three influences will be victorious. But simply approaching a city won't cut it: hazards and defenses must be navigated, or your champion won't even get close!
