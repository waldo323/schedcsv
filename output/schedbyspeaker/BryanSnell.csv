Learn how to play this Living Customizable Card Game for two players, set in the cyberpunk future of 'Android' and 'Infiltration'! One player is a megacorporation and the other is a runner. Corporations must secure their servers and data forts with security programs. Runners need to spend their time and credits developing sufficiently powerful wealth, hardware, and software to hack past corporate security measures. They risk having their best programs trashed or captured by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures, or suffer massive brain damage from a failed intrusion attempt.

"Gravwell",4/30/2016,19:00,4/30/2016,20:50,FALSE,"2-4 players. Players command spaceships that have been pulled through a black hole, transporting them into a different dimension. Lacking fuel to get home, you must collect basic elements from surrounding asteroids, using gravity and what little resources you have in order to reach the warp gate that will take you home. But in this dimension, moving ships will travel towards the nearest object, which is usually another ship. When those objects are moving either forward or backward, reaching the warp gate isn't always easy. Frozen hulks of dead spacecraft litter the escape route - but with careful cardplay, you can slingshot past these derelicts and be the first to escape from the Gravwell!
