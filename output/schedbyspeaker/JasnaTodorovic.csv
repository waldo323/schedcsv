Have fun with music with your fellow nerds- explore lead-follow dynamics- and pick up a new skill. Previous experience and coordination are NOT required. We'll be rotating partners (except for those who aren't comfortable rotating partners)- so there's no need to bring your own. Comfortable shoes are recommended.',FALSE,PUBLIC,Sound system
