The band is one part punk rock- one part Brechtian showmanship- one part dance party. With a live show that acknowledges its own artificiality- the group takes the conventions of music performance and mutates them into a spectacle of hyperbolic proportion. Here- bass guitars are seven feet long and made of construction paper- everything on stage emits blindingly bright light- and the beats of every track are pushed straight into the red.',FALSE,PUBLIC,Sound System
