"Software Patents After Alice: A Long and Sad Tale ",5/1/2016,13:00,5/1/2016,13:50,FALSE,"The last year's been very interesting for those of us who have been looking on in horror over the last decade as billions of dollars was spent on frivolous and ridiculously broad software patent litigation. The United States Supreme Court's ruling in the landmark Alice vs. CLS Bank case has finally given the lower courts some tools they could use to overturn obvious and vague patents, but there are still several things we need to pay attention to, and a very long tail to contend with. The best way to keep moving forward is for the global community to work together. This talk is for anyone who is wondering what the recent decisions mean for small and mid-size entities, how international treaties can impact local policy and what can be done to improve the situation.
