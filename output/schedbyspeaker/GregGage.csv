The secret lies in your body’s hidden electrical network that lives just below our skin and skulls: our nervous system! This talk will be hands-on demonstration of the basic principles of neuroscience and will explore the fascinating field of “electrophysiology”. Using our 'DIY' neuroscience tools, we will begin to see and hear what the brain actually looks like! We will continue to go deeper… exploring neurophysiology, functional electrical stimulation, micro-stimulation’s effect on animal behavior, neuropharmacology, even neuroprosthesis and human-to-human interfaces! (Don’t worry… all these will be explained in easy-to-follow experiments).  Speakers include:Greg Gage - Track: Penguicon  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Algonquin B/C",PUBLIC
