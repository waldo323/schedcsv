"Neurable: The Next Evolution of Brain-Computer Interfaces",5/1/2016,12:00,5/1/2016,12:50,FALSE,"One of the major human developments in the 21st century is the creation of new ways to allow people to interact and immerse with the world around them. Brian-Computer Interface has the potential to bring that interaction to a new level. However, current non-invasive brain technology is extremely limited in capability. Neurable has created the first non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows for unprecedented real-time control of physical objects and software applications, creating new ways for people to interact with the world, enabling deeper immersion in augmented reality & virtual reality (AR/VR) environments.
