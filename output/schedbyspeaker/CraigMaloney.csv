"Emulators and Emulation",4/30/2016,12:00,4/30/2016,12:50,FALSE,"Emulating a trip through Craig's childhood, one machine at a time. Desktop computers today don't have any soul. Sure you have your Linux and your Macintosh and your 'Windows' but it's all pretty much the same hardware underneath. Why not put those gigahertz to use and emulate the hardware and software of yester-year? Craig Maloney will give a tour of his childhood by showing us how to (legally) run such computers as the Atari 800XL, the Commodore Amiga, PET and C64, the Sinclair ZX series, and even some arcade games. Amaze your friends by running a room-full of 1970s and 1980s technology on more capable hardware. It's a presentation you won't want to miss!

"Sinclair ZX Computers",4/30/2016,20:00,4/30/2016,20:50,FALSE,"Why a machine I never owned is one of my favorite retro computers. In the 1980s Sinclair Research introduced a series of computers: the ZX80, ZX81, and ZX Spectrum. Originally released in the United Kingdom, they were inexpensive, somewhat unreliable, and vastly underpowered compared with the competition. Yet Craig spent the last few years collecting for this machine. Why? Should these machines be relegated as mere curiosities of a forgotten age? Has Craig gone completely mental? Come learn the history of the Sinclair machines, their foray into the USA market via Timex, and see why these machines deserve more attention than they received.
