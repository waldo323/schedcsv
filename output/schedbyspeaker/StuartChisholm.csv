Or want to learn how to shoot but without the noise, recoil and potential danger?  OR just want to have a great time?  Then the Virtual Range is a must visit!  The only things flying downrange are photons.  Our Laser pistols have the look and feel of a real Glock 17, but emit only light.  Newbies will get actual instruction from certified professionals free of charge!  This time out, we have added more reactive targets to the mix -- things that jump, fall or light up - for even more fun!  Get your 'Geek Militia' ribbon ONLY at the GwG Virtual Range!
