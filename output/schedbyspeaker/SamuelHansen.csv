"The Ethics of AI",4/25/2015,9:00,4/25/2015,9:50,FALSE,"If we develop an artificial intelligence that talks like a human, thinks like a human, and acts like a human, it will be fair to expect it to abide by the same social contract as a human. The problem is that if Artificial Intelligence comes to pass it is very unlikely that it will be anything like a human. This brings us to the very hazy area of the ethics surrounding AI. What rules do we have a right to enforce on a living entity that is nothing like us? How dangerous is it to develop something that we will not be able to fully understand and will be able to think a lot faster than us? What if AI is actually kind of dumb?

"Sports Fandom in the Geek Community",4/25/2015,13:00,4/25/2015,13:50,FALSE,"Sports and their fans are still easy targets for mockery by SF/F fans, even while athletes are watching The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones and playing World of Warcraft and Settlers of Catan. If we won the culture war, why are we still fighting it?  Speakers include:Dave Hogg, Zach Blagg, Jeannie Szarama, Samuel Hansen - Track: Life  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Charlevoix B",PUBLIC
"Creative Destruction",4/25/2015,15:00,4/25/2015,15:50,FALSE,"Is the nature of creativity really a destructive force? Progress is not necessarily a linear, geometric progression but rather destructive stimulus often precede creativity and explosive growth. We will discuss what this means from several perspectives, including economic theory, cosmology, ecology and technology.  Speakers include:Mark Haynes, Kevin O'Brien, Ethan Dicks, Samuel Hansen - Track: Science, Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: Projector ","Charlevoix C",PUBLIC
"SciComm: Communicating Science to the Public",4/25/2015,17:00,4/25/2015,17:50,FALSE,"People are not naturally uninterested in what is happening in science and mathematics. Science Communication does what it can to tell everyone the stories of science in an engaging and interesting way, but it is not an easy task. An approach that works for astronomy could well fail when talking about new mathematics research. This panel will gather together people who communicate science for a discussion about the tools and techniques they use to tell mathematical and scientific stories, and about their successes and their failures.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Constance L. Martin-Trembley, Bob Trembley, Annalee Newitz - Track: Science  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Windover",PUBLIC
"Misconceptions of Scienctific Work",4/26/2015,13:00,4/26/2015,13:50,FALSE,"Mathematicians are crazy loners that slave in front of chalkboards every second of every day in a singular pursuit of the next great theorem. Chemists pace their labs full of brightly colored chemicals and glass tubing that could have only been designed by Rube Goldberg trying to get their reactions correct. This panel will visit some of the most incorrect misconceptions in modern culture, and the most interesting, and try to set the record straight as to what our scientists are actually doing all day.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Mari Brighe - Track: Science, Life  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Windover",PUBLIC
