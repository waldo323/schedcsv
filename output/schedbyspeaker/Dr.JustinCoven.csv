"Improving Leadership with IT",4/29/2016,19:00,4/29/2016,19:50,FALSE,"Exceptional leadership is the ability to methodically and continually create heroes!   From an organizational perspective, most leadership research and theory is focused around individual leader psychology. IT Maturity takes an alternative IT perspective of leaders as entities operating within organizations, orchestrating how other entities interact with each other, to optimize productivity.  IT Maturity Leadership includes principles in five different categories: Management, Organization (structure), Extent (of activities), Culture, and Vision.  IT tools can be used to help enterprises to do this both technically and organizationally (i.e. enable individuals to excel).

"TopicHero  for Topic Heroes",4/30/2016,10:00,4/30/2016,10:50,FALSE,"TopicHero (http://TopicHero.com) allows users to create and share multiple Topics across different devices and browsers. Topic elements include Search Engines, RSS Feeds, and Links, in addition to typical web page elements. This is a different way of slicing web information, where the focus is on Topics as opposed to a focus on a Search Engine, device, browser, or RSS Feed. TopicHero arises from a philosophy that it is the topic that is critical and that users need effective tools to bring as many resources to bear on specific topics as possible. This is particularly true in business where many users are dedicated to working on specific topics for long periods of time.
