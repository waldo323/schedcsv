csvsafedescrip,Add movement- color- sound- and interactivity with a tiny computer system designed for artists and designers. Christopher Bright shows us how to use the Arduino microcontroller to take in information and then express it through lights- sounds- or motion. The potential here is limitless. Arduinos have been used to build opensource EEG machines- heart rate monitors- robotic motion controllers. In this workshop you will create a heart-rate sensor that in turn flashes an LED on time. Easy- and very fun. I will have plenty of micro boards on hand for folks to play with.

Why not put those gigahertz to use and emulate the hardware and software of yester-year? Craig Maloney will give a tour of his childhood by showing us how to (legally) run such computers as the Atari 800XL, the Commodore Amiga, PET and C64, the Sinclair ZX series, and even some arcade games. Amaze your friends by running a room-full of 1970s and 1980s technology on more capable hardware. It's a presentation you won't want to miss!"
