csvsafedescrip,There was an insane Internet reaction to the Red Wedding from those who were watching Game of Thrones but hadn’t read it (to the reader's delight).  Is this indicative of an expectation among television and movie audiences that established characters survive?  Has Hollywood created the expectation of a happy ending- even in the harshest of fictional environments?  Is it more acceptable to kill off a character in print?  How do these expectations differ amongst genre fiction?
