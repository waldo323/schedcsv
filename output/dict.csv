Book Description,"Secure Shell (SSH) servers are popular targets for password-guessing attacks. The only way to eliminate these attacks is to use key-based authentication. If you're still using password-based authentication because key-based authentication seems hard, come to this talk. Bring your laptop. You'll create your own authentication key, deploy it to your server, and make key-based authentication painless. When you go back to work after Penguicon, you'll wonder how you ever survived using passwords."
