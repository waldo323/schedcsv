Those with slightly more familiarity are aware of its reputation for being deeply arcane and full of scary math. Daniel Franke, of the NTPsec project, thinks that both these perceptions are mistaken and that NTP's apparent impenetrability is entirely a consequence of bad pedagogy. In this talk, he aims to fix that. While some background in statistics will make this talk go down a bit more smoothly, a solid grasp of high school algebra should be entirely sufficient for following along.</p><p class="presenters">Presenter(s): Daniel Franke</p></td>
