schedcsv
========

simple project with the goal of parsing a csv file from an export
from the head of programming and generating output files which are particularly useful to Penguicon 2013.


current output:
   * custom xml for program book
   * list of speakers
   * list of speakers giving 3+ "hours" of talks ( an hour in this case is defined as 50 minutes...I think)
   * full output into a csv which google calendar should be able to import (work in progress....)


hopeful additions
   * calendar views per track and one for all the GoHs
   * csv which could potentially be used by attendies... additional "interested in" column or something like that
