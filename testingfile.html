Topic elements include Search Engines, RSS Feeds, and Links, in addition to typical web page elements. This is a different way of slicing web information, where the focus is on Topics as opposed to a focus on a Search Engine, device, browser, or RSS Feed. TopicHero arises from a philosophy that it is the topic that is critical and that users need effective tools to bring as many resources to bare on specific topics as possible. This is particularly true in business where many users are dedicated to working on specific topics for long periods of time.

<td class="eventdesc"><p>Convention Resource Event Management (CREM) is an open-source web app. It catches conflicts between rooms, times, and presenters. It is flexible enough to track the necessary data about everything from LN2 Ice Cream to board games, and prevent a loud concert from being on the other side of an airwall from a quiet panel discussion. Get involved, or just satisfy your curiosity about the languages and frameworks: Javascript with Angular, and Python with Flask.</p></td>
